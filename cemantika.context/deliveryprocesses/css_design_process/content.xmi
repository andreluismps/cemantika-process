    <mainDescription>CSS demands that designers consider new aspects and challenges in comparison to traditional applications. In this sense, it
        is important to provide CSS developers with a process that could guide them through the fulfilment of context specific
        requirements. In this work, we argue that including context entails a different way of thinking about a systemâ€™s
        engineering. When designing a CSS, a major emphasis should be given to the analysis of how users interact (or are expected
        to interact) with the CSS and how these users expect the CSS to act on their behalf.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         We describe our proposal for a CSS Design Process, which details the main activities related to context specification and
        the design of CSS, providing a systematic way to execute these activities. It extends the analysis and design phases
        described in any software development lifecycle.&lt;br /></mainDescription>

        specific requirements.&lt;br /></purpose>
